<p>
  A global health crisis has provided a proving ground for telehealth as consumers become accustomed to telehealth as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The medical community is now publicizing the potential of telehealth. Approximately 70% of all health problems can be handled online. We are bringing a solution that will integrate all medical and health-related needs in one place since there are many existing Online health services that cater to different needs such as one app for medications, another one for doctors, and so on. The smart health app will offer a wide range of services such as booking an online doctor's appointment, buying medicine, booking an ambulance, obtaining lab results and a lab report, vacant bed, ICU availability status all in one place. Our app will be very beneficial for senior people and people who do not have the technological know-how to download and manage different apps, as well as being integrated with each health service, the process will be much more seamless than before.

# Problem Statement:

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Overburdened hospitals and lockdowns have forced many elderly patients to skip or postpone their regular health check-ups since the pandemic began, and there were limited medical supplies in local pharmacies, as well as many other inconveniences, which have led people to search for an alternative solution, which led to the rise of mobile health apps. While existing mobile health apps offer many services, most online health services appeal to different needs, such as one app for medications, another for doctors, and so on. The smart health app will offer a wide range of services such as booking an online doctor's appointment, buying medicine, booking an ambulance, obtaining lab results and a lab report, vacant bed, ICU availability status all in one place. Our app will be very beneficial for senior people and as well as for people who do not have the technological know-how to download and manage different apps, as well as being integrated with each health service, the process will be much more seamless than before.</p><br>


# Mission Statement:

<p>With this app, users can book/schedule an online doctor’s appointment for video consultations or physical
consultations at clinics. After a doctor prescribes medicines, those medicines will automatically be placed in
the cart under the "book your medicine" section. Whenever a doctor recommends lab tests, those will
appear under “Lab Reports”. In addition, users can book vaccines, perform covid tests, and check vaccine
availability. Various types of medicines can be purchased, alternative options will be suggested in case of
unavailability. It will also display information such as vacant beds, ICUs, oxygen availability, etc., saving
customers a lot of time and money. It can also send notifications to remind patients to take medicines in a
timely manner. Whenever a patient is not satisfied with our app's doctor or any other services, they can
submit a complaint under the feedback section, which will ensure customer satisfaction and the integrity of
the services offered.</p><br>

# Market Summary 
<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has added a new dimension to the mobile health apps market. Patients, caregivers, and medical experts relied extensively on mobile health apps for remote patient monitoring to contain the virus. Besides medical care for patients of coronavirus, these apps were extensively used for other health conditions during the pandemic. Individuals with chronic health conditions refrained from visiting health centers and hospitals for doctor consultations or follow-up visits. Collectively, this expanded the scope of growth of the mobile Health or Tele-Health apps market tremendously.Our app " Smart Health " is positioned in a market that has huge potential, the demand has risen sharply amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Our App services will be an all-in-one solution for all health-related needs, especially for the elderly.
Our solution is scalable considering the sharp demand for health-related needs such as medicines and online doctor’s video consultation, home lab reports, etc. as many are stuck at home due to the global pandemic situation, as we know already existing telehealth services offer limited services targeting specific users and services.
The pandemic has led to more and more people looking for solutions that can meet all their health-related requirements, and that too from the comfort of their homes, so we need to make sure we focus on :
* Customer-centricity
* Alignment of product development with market needs
* A focus on delivery efficiency and effectiveness
* An end-to-end (i.e., define, develop, operationalize, launch)
</p>
<p>Currently, our business is much smaller now because of our precarious financial condition, we're trying to make it bigger. We are trying to hold the opportunity this market offers us.</p>

# Competition
<p>The health apps that are currently available offer selective services, such as booking appointments with doctors and purchasing medicines. Since the pandemic, there is a greater need for all types of health services than before and it is extremely inconvenient to manage multiple applications addressing different needs. What customers need is a solution that can address all of their requirements in one place and save time. Keeping this in mind our Smart Heath aims to cater to all customer requirements
Some of the unique features offered by our app:
* All in one [Video consultation + eAppointment booking + ePharmary+ eLab Report]
* The app can read prescriptions with text detection software, which automatically places medicines and lab reports prescribed by the doctor to “book your medicine” and “book your home collection” section in the app, saving a lot of time and hassle for customers.
* All in one track feature [Vaccine, Vacant Bed, Emergency Services, Oxygen, Ambulance] availability can be tracked online via our app, Remind your medicine feature, etc.</p>

Mobile Health involves the provision of health products, services, and information through mobile and wireless technologies. Companies and institutions in the healthcare sector are progressively proposing innovative m-health solutions that simultaneously reduce costs and improve the quality of life of citizens.<br>
In order to succeed in this field, we need to focus on customer needs such as</br> 
1. Easy Access to Functionalities</br>
2. Detailed, Actionable Information</br>
3. Easy Communication with Professionals</br>
4. Patient Community</br>
5. Simple Yet Amazing Digital Experience</br>

#Implementation
<p>Our teams have designed and developed this smart health website with WordPress. We have worked on this website with the help of Google Meet API keys, a good cloud server will be used for website hosting.

Our website was created with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, VUES, React JavaScript, Node JavaScript languages ​​for coding this website.
APP was created with the help of Android Studio. Our team worked with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop for logos and other images, Adobe After Effects for video purposes. Our team set up the Secure Sockets Layer Certificate for security. We also utilized Google Meet's API keys. For coding our team has created apps with Java, NODE JavaScript, React JavaScript languages. Our app will adopt Aggregator Business Model which has created huge success in various industries be it the hotel industry, taxi industry, groceries, home-care, home delivery, or other on-demand services, the aggregator model has disrupted each sector for better. The model flourishes around the concept of organizing an unorganized business sector and labeling it under its own brand. Using this business ecosystem, we will be able to connect buyers and sellers. We will be partnering with all types of health care services providers, like hospitals, pharmacies, diagnostic centers, vaccine centers, etc. We can bring health care closer to the customer's pocket than ever before.
