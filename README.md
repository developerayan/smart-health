  A global health crisis has provided a proving ground for telehealth as consumers become accustomed to telehealth as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The medical community is now publicizing the potential of telehealth. Approximately 70% of all health problems can be handled online. We are bringing a solution that will integrate all medical and health-related needs in one place since there are many existing Online health services that cater to different needs such as one app for medications, another one for doctors, and so on. The smart health app will offer a wide range of services such as booking an online doctor's appointment, buying medicine, booking an ambulance, obtaining lab results and a lab report, vacant bed, ICU availability status all in one place. Our app will be very beneficial for senior people and people who do not have the technological know-how to download and manage different apps, as well as being integrated with each health service, the process will be much more seamless than before.
